# DrahiX Power Consumption Forecast
This repository provides a ***non-stationary time series forecast benchmark*** using DrahiX power consumption dataset. The dataset has a 1-hour granularity and contains 42,481 rows from 2016 to 2021. The data is from a single building divided into 7 zones (T1 to T7) and the sum of all columns (TGBT).

## Implementation
The deep learning models for the forecast were implemented using TensorFlow. The following models were used:

- CNN-LTSM
- Seq2Seq
- TCN-LTSM
- Attention-BiLTSM
- Seq2Seq-Attention
- Multihead-Attention
- Time2Vec-BiLTSM
- Time2Vec-Transformer

The benchmark for the models ranges from 1 to 24 hours, with 168 and 672 hours of window data on the 8 columns.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found in the data directory. It is stored in a CSV format and can be accessed using pandas or any other tool for data analysis. The dataset has a total size of approximately 3.7 MB.

## Usage
To use the code, you need to have TensorFlow installed in your environment. The code is written in Python,in a Notebook.
